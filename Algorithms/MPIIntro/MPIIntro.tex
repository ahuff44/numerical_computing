\section*{Why Parallel Computing?} Over the past few decades, vast increases in
computational power have come through increased single processor performance,
which have almost wholly been driven by smaller transistors. However, these
faster transistors generate more heat, which destabilizes circuits. The so-
called ``heat wall'' refers to the physical limits of single processors to
become faster because of the growing inability to sufficiently dissipate heat.

Parallel computing was invetened to circumvent this physical limitation. It
began, as with most things, in many different systems and styles. Some systems
had shared memory between many processors and some systems had a separate
program for each processor while others ran all the processors off the same base
program.

Today, the most commonly used method for high performance computing is a single-
program, multiple-data system with message passing. Essentially, this means that
supercomputers are made up of many, many normal computers, each with their own
memory. These normal computers are all running the same program and are able to
communicate with each other. Although they all run the same program file, each
process takes a different execution path through the code, as a result of the
interactions that message passing makes possible.

Note that the commands being executed by two different processes are going to be
different. Thus, we could actually write two separate computer programs in
different files to accomplish this. However, the most common method today has
become to write both processes in a single program, using conditionals and
techniques from the Message Passing Interface to control which lines of code get
executed by each process.

This is a very different architecture than ``normal'' computers, and it requires
a different kind of software. You can't take a traditional program and expect it
to magically run faster on a supercomputer; you must design new algorithms in
ways that take advantage of the unique advantages of parallel computing.

\section*{MPI: the Message Passing Interface} At its most basic, the Message
Passing Interface (MPI) provides functions for sending and receiving messages
between different processes. You can think of a process as one of the many
``normal'' computers that make up a supercomputer.

MPI was developed out of the need for standardization of programming parallel
systems. It is different than other approaches in that MPI does not require
programs to be written in a particular language. Rather, MPI specifies a library
of functions--the syntax and semantics of message passing routines--that can be
called from other programming languages, such as Python and C. MPI provides a
very powerful and very general way of expressing parallelism. It can be thought
of as ``the assembly language of parallel computing,'' because of this
generality and the detail that it forces the programmer to deal
with\footnote{Parallel Programming with MPI, by Peter S. Pacheco, p. 7}. In
spite of this apparent drawback, MPI is still very important. It was the first
portable, universally available standard for programming parallel systems, and
it is the \emph{de facto} standard today. MPI makes it possible for programmers
to develop portable, parallel software libraries. Until recently, one of the
biggest problems in parallel computing was the lack of software. However,
parallel software is growing faster thanks in large part to this
standardization.

% \begin{problem}

% MPI is designed differ what POSIX threads or OpenMP is designed for? What is the
% difference between MPI and OpenMP or Pthreads?
% \end{problem}
% TODO research this yourself and figure out whether multiple MPI processes can be run on a single computer

\section*{Why MPI for Python?} In general, parallel programs are much more
difficult and complex than ``normal'', serial programs. Python is an excellent
language for algorithm design and for solving problems that don't require
maximum performance. This makes Python great for prototyping and writing small
or medium-sized parallel programs. However, Python is not designed specifically
for high performance computing and its parallel capabilities are still somewhat
underdeveloped, so in practice it is better to write production code in fast,
compiled languages, such as C or Fortran.

We will use the Python library \texttt{mpi4py}. This package implements the
Message Passing Interface in a basic way that makes it relatively easy to port
your code to a faster language such as C for production code.

\section*{Introduction to MPI}
As tradition has it, we will start with a Hello World program.
\lstinputlisting[style=fromfile]{hello.py}
Save this program as \texttt{hello.py} and execute it from the command line as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=ShellInput]
$ mpirun -n 3 python hello.py
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{info}
If the program fails to start, you may need to try the following syntax:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=ShellInput]
$ mpirun -n 3 python.exe hello.py
\end{lstlisting}
\end{info}
The program should output something like this:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=ShellOutput]
Hello world! I'm process number 2 out of 3.
Hello world! I'm process number 0 out of 3.
Hello world! I'm process number 1 out of 3.
\end{lstlisting}

Notice that when you try this on your own, the lines will not necessarily print
in order. The five processes will run autonomously, so their output could be
printed in any order.

\begin{warn}
Unless you are debugging, it is usually bad practice to perform I/O (e.g., call
\li{print}) from any process other than the root process (the \emph{root
process} is the process with rank 0)
\end{warn}

\section*{Execution}
How does this program work? When we execute
\begin{lstlisting}[style=ShellInput]
$ mpirun -n 3 python hello.py
\end{lstlisting}
a number of things happen:

First, the \texttt{mpirun} program is launched. This is the program which starts
MPI, a wrapper around whatever program you to pass into it. The ``-n 3'' option
specifies the desired number of processes. In this case, three processes are
initialized. The rest of this command, ``python hello.py'', is the command that
each process will run. Thus, each of the five processes will run a copy of
\texttt{hello.py} in its own execution environment, separate from the other two
processes. These three execution environments are identical except for one key
difference: Each process is assigned a different ``rank'' within the
\texttt{mpirun} program. Because of this, each process prints a different number
when it executes.

What are ranks and how do they work? When \texttt{mpirun} is first executed, it
creates a global communicator object. Each process can access can access this
object through the variable \li{MPI.COMM_WORLD} within the Python program. One
of the main purposes of this communicator is to keep track of each process's
``rank'', which is a unique identifier.

When each process executes the line \li{RANK = COMM.Get_rank()}, the process
queries the global communicator to figure out what the process's ``rank'' is.
Process ranks are essential to interprocess communication and coordination
because they are the only difference between each process's otherwise identical
execution environment.

After each process executes the line \li{RANK = COMM.Get_rank()}, each process's
local variable \li{RANK} will be different from each of the other two processes.
This gives us a way to distinguish between different processes while allowing us
to write the source code for the three processes in a single file.

\section*{MPI Communicators} An MPI communicator object basically just
represents a collection of processes. Although processes can access
communicators through the interface MPI provides, communicators' data is stored
within the execution environment of the \texttt{mpirun} environment, not within
the execution environments of the individual processes.

Communicators allow processes to send and receive messages. In most of our
programs we will only deal with the \li{MPI.COMM_WORLD} communicator, which
contains all of the running processes.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:MPI_program_structure} demonstrates how MPI programs are
structured. Each of the python processes execute independently from the others.
%TODO explain this better
%TODO Get better graphic

\begin{info}
In more advanced MPI programs, it is possible to create custom communicators
that group certain subsets of the processes together. This can be useful
(especially in supercomputers) because MPI can physically rearrange which
processes are assigned to which CPUs, thereby optimizing your program's speed by
making sure that the processes within each communicator can quickly communicate
with each other.

Note that a single process can be a member of many different communicators, and
that its rank will most likely be different in each communicator. However, since
our programs will just be using the global communicator \li{MPI.COMM_WORLD}, we
can think of ranks as being unique IDs assigned to each process.
\end{info}

\begin{problem}
Write a program in which the the processes with an even rank print ``Hello'' and
process with an odd rank print ``Goodbye''. Additionally, each process should
print its rank and the total number of processes currently running. This program
should work for any number of processes. For example, if you run this program
with 6 processes, process 3 should print ``Goodbye from process 3 out of 6''.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Sometimes, a parallel algorithm can only run correctly if it has a certain
number of processes. Although you typically want to avoid writing these kinds of
programs, sometimes it is inconvenient or unavoidable. Write a program that runs
only if it has exactly 5 processes. Upon failure, the root process should print
``Error: This program must run with exactly 5 processes'' and upon success
\emph{every} process should print ``Success!'' (To exit, call the function
\li{COMM.Abort()} from the root process)
\end{problem}

\section*{Simple Message Passing} Let us begin by demonstrating a program
designed for two processes. One will draw a random number and then send it to
the other. We will do this using the methods \li{Comm.Send} and \li{Comm.Recv}
(short for ``receive''):

\lstinputlisting[style=fromfile]{passValue.py}

To illustrate simple message passing, we have one process choose a random number
and then pass it to the other. Inside the recieving process, we have it print
out the value of the variable \li{num_buffer} \emph{before} it calls \li{Recv}
to prove that it really is recieving the variable through the message passing
interface.

Here is the syntax for \li{Send} and \li{Recv}, where \li{Comm} is a
communicator object:

\begin{description}
\item[Comm.Send(buf, dest=0, tag=0)]
Performs a basic send. This send is a point-to-point communication. It sends information from exactly one process to exactly one other process.
Parameters:
\begin{description}
\item[buf (array-like)] – data to send.

    % TODO expand here- must be numpy array (as a pointer) and won't work with strings

\item[dest (integer)] – rank of destination
\item[tag (integer)] – message tag
\end{description}
Example:
\begin{lstlisting}
#Send_example.py
from mpi4py import MPI
import numpy as np

RANK = MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank()

a = np.zeros(1, dtype=int)  # This must be an array
if RANK == 0:
    a[0] = 10110100
    MPI.COMM_WORLD.Send(a, dest=1)
elif RANK == 1:
    MPI.COMM_WORLD.Recv(a, source=0)
    print a[0]
\end{lstlisting}
\item[Comm.Recv(buf, source=0, tag=0, Status status=None)]
Basic point-to-point receive of data.
Parameters:
\begin{description}
\item[buf (array-like)] – initial address of receive buffer (choose receipt location)
\item[source (integer)] – rank of source
\item[tag (integer)] – message tag
\item[status (Status)] – status of object
\end{description}
Example:
See example for Send()
\end{description}

\begin{info}
\li{Send} and \li{Recv} are referred to as \emph{blocking} functions. That is, if a process calls \li{Recv}, it will sit idle until it has received a message from a corresponding \li{Send} before it will proceeed. (However, the process that calls \li{Comm.Send} will \emph{not} necessarily block until the message is recieved- it depends on the implementation) There are corresponding \emph{non-blocking} functions \li{Isend} and \li{Irecv} (The \emph{I} stands for immediate). In essence, \li{Irecv} will return immediately. If a process calls \li{Irecv} and doesn't find a message ready to be picked up, it will indicate to the system that it is expecting a message, proceed beyond the \li{Irecv} to do other useful work, and then check back later to see if the message has arrived. This can be used to dramatically improve performance.
\end{info}

% TODO ASK is Send blocking in C? It isn't in python... I added in a note here

\begin{info}
When calling \li{Comm.Recv}, you can allow the calling process to accept a message from any process that happend to be sending to the receiving process. This is done by setting source to a predefined MPI constant, \li{source=ANY_SOURCE} (note that you would first need to import this with from \li{mpi4py.MPI import ANY_SOURCE} or use the syntax \li{source=MPI.ANY_SOURCE}).
\end{info}


\begin{problem}
Write a Python script \texttt{passVector.py} (adapted from \texttt{passValue.py}) that passes an $n$ by $1$ vector of random values from one process to the other. Write it so that the user passes the value of $n$ in as a command-line argument (similar to the code developed later in this lab for the trapezoidal rule).
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Try modifying some of the parameters in \li{Send} and \li{Recv} in the code from the previous exercise (\li{dest}, \li{source}, and \li{tag}).  What happens to the program? Does it hang or crash? What do you suppose the \li{tag} parameter does?
\end{problem}
% TODO delete this one?

\begin{problem}
Write a Python script \texttt{passCircular.py} (again adapted from \texttt{passValue.py}). This time, write the program so that each process with rank $i$ sends a random value to the process with rank $i+1$ in the global communicator. The process with the highest rank will send its random value to the root process. Notice that we are communicating in a ring. For communication, only use \li{Send} and \li{Recv}. The program should work for any number of processes. (Hint: Remember that \li{Send} and \li{Recv} are blocking functions. Does the order in which \li{Send} and \li{Recv} are called matter?)
% TODO \li{} for referencing file?
\end{problem}

\section*{The Trapezoidal Rule}
Now that we understand basic communication in MPI, we will proceed by parallelizing our first algorithm--numerical integration using the ``trapezoidal rule.'' Early on in most calculus classes, students learn to estimate integrals using the trapezoidal rule. A range to be integrated is divided into many vertical slivers, and each sliver is approximated with a trapezoid. The area of each trapezoid is computed, and then all their areas are added together.

% LaTeX to display the trapezoidal rule:
\begin{eqnarray*}%{rcl}
\textrm{Area}
&\approx&
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\frac{[f(a+i \Delta x)+f(a + (i+1) \Delta x)]}{2}\cdot\Delta x \\
&=&
\left[-\frac{f(a)+f(b)}{2}+\sum_{i=0}^{n}f(a+i\Delta x)\right]\cdot\Delta x
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\Delta x=(b-a)/n$.

% Trapezoid rule picture:
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{TrapezoidRule.png}
\caption{The trapezoid rule in action. TODO get a copyright-kosher version.}
\label{fig:trapezoidal_rule}
\end{figure}
% I took this template for icluding images from the data structures lab

In Python, a simple serial formulation of the trapezoidal rule would be as follows:

\lstinputlisting[style=fromfile]{trapSerial.py}

A moment of thought should convince the reader that this algorithm reflects the formula given above.

\section*{Parallelizing the Trapezoidal Rule}
The first and most important step in parallelizing an algorithm is determining which computations are independent. With the trapezoidal rule, it's easy to see that the area of each trapezoid can be calculated independently, so dividing the data at the trapezoid level seems natural.

Currently, the algorithm divides up the interval into $n$ subintervals. To parallelize this process, we will distribute these $n$ subintervals to the available processes:

\lstinputlisting[style=fromfile]{trapParallel_1.py}

In this parallel approach, the original interval is split such that each process gets an equal-sized subinterval to integrate. After integrating, each process sends its result to the root node, which sums up the results and displays them. Although this is fairly straightforward, there are two important things to note:

First, notice how the trapezoids are divided among the processes: The processors each individually calculate the specifics of which subinterval they will be integrating. We could have written the algorithm such that process 0 divides up the work for the other processors and tells them each what their ranges are. However, this would introduce an unnecessary bottleneck: all of the other processes would be idling while waiting for their assignment to arrive from the root process. By having each process calculate its own range, we gain a large speedup.

Second, notice how the results are summed. We know how many results we should be receiving, so the root process simply accepts the messages in the order that they arrive. This is achieved using the tag \li{MPI.ANY_SOURCE} in the \li{COMM.Recv} method. In following labs we will learn about even more effective ways to gather the results of many different processes' computations.
% todo link to lab where we learn gather (next lab). Talk about the speed up we gained here? but in this case there is no speedup...

% MPI has two mechanisms specifically designed to partition the message space: tags and communicators. The tag parameter is there in the case that two messages with the same size and datatype are sent to the same process. In that case, the program would not necessarily be able to tell apart the data. So the programmer can attach different tags that he or she defines to the sent data to keep them straight.
% TODO find somewhere else for this paragraph to fit in maybe? Maybe as the answer to that problem from the intro that asks what tags do?

At this point, you should test the code for yourself. Save the code in a file named \texttt{trapParallel\_1.py} and try running it from the command line using the following input:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=ShellInput]
$ mpirun -n 4 python trapParallel_1.py 0.0 1.0 10000
\end{lstlisting}
The output should appear like this:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=ShellOutput]
With 10000 trapezoids, our estimate of the integral of x^2 from 0.0 to 1.0 is:
    0.333333335
\end{lstlisting}
We have successfully parallelized our first algorithm!


\section*{Load Balancing}
Although we have parallelized the trapezoidal rule, our algorithm is still rather naive. Notice that if the number of processes does not evenly divide the number of trapezoids, the code will break down. Try running the trapezoid program with n = 10007 trapezoids:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=ShellInput]
$ mpirun -n 4 python trapParallel_1.py 0.0 1.0 10007
\end{lstlisting}
This will produce the following:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=ShellOutput]
With 10007 trapezoids, our estimate of the integral of x^2 from 0.0 to 1.0 is:
    0.333233404949
\end{lstlisting}

We know that the estimate of the integral should improve as $n$ grows larger, but this estimate is much worse. This happened because \li{local_n}, the number of trapezoids that each processor calculates, must be an integer. To solve this problem, we could require that the user always choose a value of $n$ that is divisible by the number of processors. However, good parallel code should let the user worry as little as possible about the parallelization and should function exactly as the serial version does. Thus, we should improve the code to let it handle the case where $n$ is not divisible by the number of processes.

One way to solve this problem would be to designate one process to handle the leftover trapezoids that; i.e. give each process \li{int(n/SIZE)} trapezoids and assign the remaining \li{n \% SIZE} trapezoids to the last process as well. Thus, the \li{local_n} of each process would be an integer. However, this method can be incredibly inefficient: What if we ran the program with $100$ processes and $n=1099$ trapezoids? Then each process would have \li{int(1099/100) = 10} trapezoids to calculate... except for the last process, which would have \li{10 + 1099 \% 100 = 109} trapezoids!

\emph{A parallel program can only be as fast as its slowest process.} We call this principle \emph{load balancing}. In this case, one process has to do over ten times as much work as the other processes! The other processes will end up waiting idle until the last one finishes. Ignoring communication costs and other overhead, this program could be nearly 10 times faster if we divided up the work more evenly. The important concept to remember is that any time a process is idling, we are losing efficiency.

In the case of the trapezoidal rule, load-balancing the code means two things. First, between any two processes, the number of trapezoids given to each must differ by at most $1$. Second, each process should estimate the area of a contiguous group of trapezoids. Although estimating an integral is not a very time-consuming operation, by estimating over contiguous groups of trapezoids we are minimizing the amount of duplicate work the processes have to do, which is good practice.

\begin{problem}
Implement the \emph{load-balancing} fix to the code \texttt{trapParallel\_1.py}. The program should be able to take in any number of trapezoids $n$ for any number of processes and the trapezoids should be divided among the processes evenly, differing by at most one between any two processes. Each process should independently calculate which section of trapezoids it should calculate.

For example, if the program is run with 5 processes and 12 trapezoids, processes 0 should calculate the first 3 trapezoids, process 1 should calculate the next 3 trapezoids, process 2 should calculate the next 2 trapezoids, process 3 should calculate the next 2 trapezoids, and process 4 should calculate the last 2 trapezoids.
\end{problem}
